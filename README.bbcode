Fac is a command-line mod manager for Factorio >=0.13 written in Python 3.

Platforms: All

[spoiler=Installation]

You'll need Python 3, which can be obtained through your distribution's
package manager or downloaded from [url=https://www.python.org/]https://www.python.org/[/url] (for Windows users).

Installation can be easily done using pip:
[code]
$ pip3 install fac-cli
[/code]

Or directly from git:
[code]
$ pip3 install -e "git+https://github.com/mickael9/fac.git#egg=fac-cli"
[/code]

Or from an existing clone:
[code]
$ pip3 install -e .
[/code]

NOTE (Linux users): By default, these commands will require you to be root unless you
run pip from a virtualenv or you use the --user flag.

If you run pip with the --user flag, make sure ~/.local/bin is in your PATH
or the fac command will not work.
[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Configuration]

fac needs to be able to know the location of:
[list]
[*]The Factorio data directory, e.g. /usr/share/factorio/
[*]The Factorio configuration directory, e.g. ~/.factorio
[/list]

Normally, it should be able to detect these automatically assuming you have a standard
setup (e.g. Steam).
It will also look in the current working directory and its parent.

If for some reason these paths can't be found automatically, you'll have to specify
them in fac's config file, which is located at:
[list]
[*]~/.config/fac/config.ini on Linux
[*]C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\fac\config.ini on Windows
[*]~/Library/Application Support/fac/config.ini on Mac OS X
[/list]
[code]
[paths]
data-path = /home/me/my_factorio/data
write-path = /home/me/my_factorio
[/code]

You can display the currently detected locations using fac -v:
[code]
$ fac -v
DEBUG:fac.main:Factorio write path: /home/mickael/.factorio
DEBUG:fac.main:Factorio game path: /usr/share/factorio
DEBUG:fac.main:Factorio version: 0.13.9

[spoiler=Usage]

fac can be run using the fac command.
It is further divided into several subcommands:

[/code]

[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Packing and unpacking mods]

Mods can be either packed (name_0.1.zip) or unpacked (name_0.1/) and the game will
accept both of them.

Keep in mind that the game will refuse to start if there is both a packed and unpacked
version of a mod, or if there are multiple installed versions for any given mod.
[code]
$ fac unpack yarm
Unpacking: /home/mickael/.factorio/mods/YARM_0.7.105.zip
Removing file: /home/mickael/.factorio/mods/YARM_0.7.105.zip
YARM is now unpacked

$ fac pack yarm
Packing: /home/mickael/.factorio/mods/YARM_0.7.105/
Removing directory: /home/mickael/.factorio/mods/YARM_0.7.105/
YARM is now packed
[/code]

[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Using wildcards]

Commands that work on locally installed mods can accept wildcards, e.g.:
[code]
$ fac remove '5dim_*'
The following files will be removed:
    /home/mickael/.factorio/mods/5dim_logistic_0.13.1.zip
    /home/mickael/.factorio/mods/5dim_core_0.13.1.zip
Continue? [Y/n]
Removing: /home/mickael/.factorio/mods/5dim_logistic_0.13.1.zip
Removing: /home/mickael/.factorio/mods/5dim_core_0.13.1.zip

$ fac enable '*'
advanced-logistics-system was already enabled
Warehousing was already enabled
YARM was already enabled
Foreman is now enabled
[/code]

Note the presence of quotes around filters to prevent the shell from interpreting them.

[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Mod name autocorrection]

Most commands will try to guess the correct name when given inexact mod names.

If the name is a filter (e.g. 5dim_*), no attempt to autocorrect will be made.

The following attempts are made to find a match for a given mod name:
[list]
[*]Exact match
[*]Case-insensitive match
[*]Partial case-insensitive match if there is no ambiguity.
[*]For remote commands (install, update...), the search result if there is only one.
[/list]

For remote commands, a local match will first be attempted at each step.

For instance:
[list]
[*]yarm will be converted to YARM via the Case-insensitive match strategy
[*]ya will either be converted to YARM if you have YARM installed
or fail because there is more than one result to the fac search ya command.
[/list]

[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Game version incompatibilities]

Mods are tied to a specific Factorio version (e.g. 0.13, 0.14) and can only work
with that version. A 0.14 game will refuse to load a mod made for 0.13.

By default, fac will autodetect your installed Factorio version and use that to filter
the available commands to compatible mods.

In some cases, you might want to disable this filtering using the -i option.
You can also override the detected game version using -g 0.13 for instance.

A make-compatible command is provided. It will automatically unpack a mod and change
its Factorio_version field to the currently set game version
(autodetected or provided by the -g option).

[b][size=125]Usage scenario[/size][/b]

You're currently running Factorio 0.14 and want to install your favorite mod, YARM:
[code]
$ fac search YARM
Note: 1 mods were hidden because they have no compatible game versions. Use -i to show them.

$ fac search YARM -i
Yet Another Resource Monitor Fork
    Name: YARM
    Tags: incompatible, info

This mod helps you to keep track of your mining sites.
[/code]

Feeling courageous, you want to try it anyway:
[code]
$ fac install -i YARM
[...]

$ fac make-compatible YARM
Unpacking: /home/mickael/.factorio/mods/YARM_0.7.105.zip
Removing file: /home/mickael/.factorio/mods/YARM_0.7.105.zip
Game version changed to 0.14 for YARM 0.7.105.
[/code]

You can now use the mod as if it was made for Factorio 0.14.

[/spoiler]
[spoiler=ZSH completion script]

If you're using ZSH (and you should be!) you can install the provided completion script
for a better experience.

You'll need to add the zsh directory to your fpath using something like this in
your .zshrc :
[code]
fpath+=(/path/to/fac/zsh)
[/code]

If you installed fac using pip as root, the script should automatically be installed in
the right place (/usr/share/zsh/site-functions).

With pip --user, you'll need to add this in your .zshrc :
[code]
fpath+=(~/.local/share/zsh/site-functions)
[/code]

Note: compinit must be called after fpath is changed so you must either put your changes before
compinit or add another compinit call after changing fpath.
